# fuck_grunt

Concat and minify the javascript and CSS on any webpage. Just point fuck_grunt at the page and it'll give you
back the html, js, and css files.

This is definitely a hack, but useful if you already have a running site and just want to combine and minify your files
without spending a lot of time getting a whole grunt setup going. Yes you'll have to do it again if you change any code,
but that's why this is called a hack. =-)
